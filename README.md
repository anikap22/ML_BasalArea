# Machine learning project to predict forest basal area increment

Machine learning project to predict forest basal area increment using supervised learning. The response variable is the basal area increment of forest plots (data from the USFS FIA database) and predictors are: MAT, MAP, N deposition, SMAP, NDVI (NASA), EVI (NASA), FPAR/LAI (MODIS), ET (MODIS), GPP/NPP (MODIS), soil thickness (ORNL), soil C (ORNL), global soil products (ORNL), soil P (ORNL), soil type (ORNL). Machine learning algorithms tested include: Random Forest, XGBoost, and GBM light, and linear regression.
